All types with \nProba\n in their names are meant to represent probabilistic networks, and are also part of the union type \nProbabilisticNetwork\n. All types \nwithout\n \nProba\n in their name are part of the union type \nDeterministicNetwork\n, and represent networks in which interactions are either present or absent. All types with \nQuanti\n in their names are part of the \nQuantitativeNetwork\n groups, and represent networks with weighted interactions. All types starting with \nBipartite\n are also part of the abstract type \nBipartite\n, and types with \nUnipartite\n in their names are part of the abstract type \nUnipartite\n. Finally, both \nUnipartite\n and \nBipartite\n are part of the abstract type \nEcoNetwork\n.\n\n\nAlthough this may seem convoluted, this is important to understand: when writing functions, you can restrict them to any type of network you want by using the right type in their declaration. You can also check properties of a network just by looking at its type. For example, one can check whether a network \nN\n is bipartite with:\n\n\ntypeof\n(\nN\n)\n \n:\n \nBipartite\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetworks are represented as two-dimensional matrices. All types are simply wrappers around an adjacency matrix, stored as the \nA\n property of the object. To look at the adjacency matrix of a network \nN\n, one therefore uses \nN.A\n. These matrices must be read as: the existence/probability of an interaction \nfrom\n the species of the \ni\n-th row \nto\n the species in the \nj\n-th column. This implies that the networks are, by default, directed.\n\n\nNote that the type of a network will determine what methods can be applied to it. For example, all measures of variance are only making sense for probabilistic networks.\n\n\n\n\nData types\n\n\nInteractions in deterministic networks are represented as boolean (\ntrue\n/\nfalse\n) values. This is memory efficient, so large networks can be represented (one interactions represented as a boolean uses 8 times fewer memory than the same interaction represented as an integer). This being said, all networks of the \nDeterministicNetwork\n type can be read from matrices of integers, \nas long as these matrices only contain 0 and 1\n.\n\n\nIn probabilistic networks, interactions are stored as floating point (\nFloat64\n) numbers. These values have to be between 0.0 and 1.0, as they represent probabilities. In quantitative networks, interactions are stored as any type of number.\n\n\nNetworks of the \nUnipartite\n class must have the same number of rows and columns. The species in the rows and columns are the same. Networks of the \nBipartite\n class are expected to have different numbers of rows and columns, as the species in rows and columns are different species.
